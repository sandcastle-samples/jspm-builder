# JSPM Builder
Test for getting JSPM bundling working with typescript

## Outstanding

Why is `jquery` / `lodash` not importing?


## ES6 Module Notes

- When importing jQuery,because it's a global function it cannot be imported normally (`import * as $ from 'jquery'`)


## Scripts

```
sh script/update
sh script/build
sh script/server
```
